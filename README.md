# Pathfinding Visualizer

This is a simple pathfinding visualizer implemented in Python using the Pygame library. It allows you to interactively place start and end points, as well as obstacles, and visualize various pathfinding algorithms.

## Features
- Place start and end nodes.
- Add obstacles to the grid.
- Visualize pathfinding algorithms:
  - A* (A Star)
  - Dijkstra's
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Greedy Best-First Search

## Getting Started
1. Make sure you have Python and Pygame
2. Clone this repository:  git clone https://github.com/GlennWilliam/PathVisualizer.git
3. Navigate to the project directory:
4. Run the visualizer: python main.py
5. To change the algorithm, change the algorithm function on the main.py

## Usage

- Left-click: Place start and end nodes, and add obstacles.
- Right-click: Remove nodes and obstacles.
- Press 'Space': Run the selected pathfinding algorithm.
- Press 'C': Clear the grid.
- Press 'Ctrl + X': Quit the program.
